# HW06WeatherDashboard

In this assignment, we created a Weather Dashboard.

When you enter the landing page, enter a city in the input, and press the search button. 

Upon searching, you will see the current weather, the 5 day forecast, and the UV Index of the city that you searched. 

Along with the weather conditions; you will be prodvided with the:
1. Current and future (5 day forecast) Temperature;
2. Current and future (5 day forecast) Humidity;
3. Current and future (5 day forecast) Wind Speed.

These values were derived by pulling information from an API (Application Programming Interface).
